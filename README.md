metaxploit console for easy exploit managements and cool UI/UX
## Implemented functions
- cracking files, encryptions.
- assign & check info on exploits
- msfconsole(real program) inspired UI and commands
- offline database of exploits
## to-add
- post-exploitation running after shell gained
  this could be bank & mail crack or */etc/passwd* or run user-made programs
- simple vulnerability checker & exploiter
- port scanner
- more & more

## Note
I do not plan whatsoever to add a filesystem management like cd, cat, touch etc..
I did add ps, but this is an exploitation tool not a shell improviser
