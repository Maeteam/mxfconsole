# mxfconsole
latest version: 0.67
this project is a mockup of the real program called "msfconsole", since the game's exploit library is called metaxploit i thought it would be a funny name
## Note: this is a project for a game called grey hack.
Links to the main game

## Implemented functions
- cracking files, encryptions.
- assign & check info on exploits
- msfconsole(real program) inspired UI and commands
- offline database of exploits
- simple built in function to attack IPs
## to-add
- post-exploitation running after shell gained
  this could be bank & mail crack or */etc/passwd* or run user-made programs
- port scanner
- more & more

## Note
I do not plan whatsoever to add a filesystem management like cd, cat, touch etc..
I did add ps, but this is an exploitation tool not a shell improviser
