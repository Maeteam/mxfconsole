# mxfconsole

latest version: **0.67**  
this project is a mockup of the real program called `msfconsole`. since the game's exploit library is called **metaxploit**, i thought it would be a funny name.

### Note: this is a project for a game called **Grey Hack**.

## About the Project

**mxfconsole** is an exploitation interface inspired by `msfconsole`, built for use within **Grey Hack**. It replicates some of the familiar behavior and structure of real-life pentesting tools while working entirely within the game's scripting system. It's intended for learning, fun, and gameplay enhancement.

## Installation

You can download/copy the `mxfconsole` file along with mxfinstaller
first run mxfinstaller as admin, the program requires root access for better protection
if you prefer using singleplayer, modify the script to your needs, then start the mxfconsole script!
