About the Project
mxfconsole is a fictional exploitation tool designed for use within the game Grey Hack. It is heavily inspired by the real-world tool Metasploit's msfconsole, tailored for Grey Hack's unique environment. The name "mxfconsole" is a playful twist, aligning with the game's metaxploit exploit library.

This tool provides a familiar terminal interface for exploit execution, vulnerability management, and penetration testing in a sandboxed game world.

⚠️ Note: This project is for Grey Hack only and does not function outside the game's scripting environment.

Built With
Grey Hack Scripting Language

Mockup of msfconsole UI/CLI principles

Features
Crack Files & Encryptions: Simplifies brute-forcing and deciphering of file content.

Exploit Info Management: Assign, modify, and inspect exploit metadata in an offline DB.

msfconsole-Inspired UI: Familiar interface with commands like use, set, and run.

Offline Exploit Database: Includes preloaded vulnerabilities for testing and attacks.

Basic IP Attack Functionality: Launch exploits against discovered IPs with one command.
