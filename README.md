# mxfconsole
## Sadly - This project is unfinished.
## I will post 0.67 Right now, you can do whatever you want with the source code.

latest version: **0.67**  
This project is inspired by the real world program called `msfconsole` since the game's exploit library is called metaxploit, the name is pretty self-explanatory, and it functions and has pretty much the exact same usage.
<br>
`this tool is mostly for single player and for people who like having some action left rather than a multitool that does everything.`
### Note: this is a project for a game called **Grey Hack**.

## About the Project

**mxfconsole** is an exploitation interface inspired by `msfconsole`, built for use within **Grey Hack**. It replicates some of the familiar behavior and structure of real-life pentesting tools while working entirely within the game's scripting system.
### this project's code will go in github as early as possible - estimate: 1 month
### This program is not capable of completing level 2+ missions by <ins>itself</ins> *for now*

## Features

- Decipher files
- Assigning & inspecting information on exploits
- UI and command style inspired by `msfconsole`
- Offline database of known exploits
- Simple built-in function to automatically scan & exploit vulnerable memory addresses

## Usage

## To add

- Bug Fixes
- Fluent interface and more functions
- better exploit management
- more customization
- msfvenom, create rshell binaries


## How it works

The mxfconsole program is able to create info files of exploits, making it very easy to use exploits without having an external file or using brain capacity remembering what exploit does what or even worse, naming them after their library & version.
with it you just download files into a local database in /database/exploits, the mxfconsole program reads it and is able to run exploits from there making it clear your user folder.

## Installation

You can download/copy the `mxfconsole` file along with `mxfinstaller`
first run mxfinstaller as root, the program requires root access for better protection
if you prefer using singleplayer, modify the script to your needs, then start the mxfconsole script!
