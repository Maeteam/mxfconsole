# mxfconsole

latest version: **0.67**  
this project is a mockup of the real program called `msfconsole`. since the game's exploit library is called **metaxploit**, mxfconsole works as a good name

### Note: this is a project for a game called **Grey Hack**.

## About the Project

**mxfconsole** is an exploitation interface inspired by `msfconsole`, built for use within **Grey Hack**. It replicates some of the familiar behavior and structure of real-life pentesting tools while working entirely within the game's scripting system.

---

## Features

- Cracking files and encryption types
- Assigning & inspecting information on exploits
- UI and command style inspired by `msfconsole`
- Offline database of known exploits
- Simple built-in function to attack IPs

## Usage

## To add

## How it works

The mxfconsole program is able to create info files of exploits, making it very easy to use exploits without having an external file or using brain capacity remembering what exploit does what or even worse, naming them after their library & version.
with it you just download files into a local database in /database/exploits, the mxfconsole program reads it and is able to run exploits from there making it clear your user folder.

## Installation

You can download/copy the `mxfconsole` file along with `mxfinstaller`
first run mxfinstaller as root, the program requires root access for better protection
if you prefer using singleplayer, modify the script to your needs, then start the mxfconsole script!
